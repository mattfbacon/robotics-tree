	<h1>Installing a Motor</h1>
	<p>In this document, we install a motor onto a C-channel, and then control it with a built-in VEX program.</p>
	<hr />
	<div class="content"><h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Gather the necessary parts. See the Step 5 image for VEX electronics:</p>
<ul>
<li>VEX Motor</li>
<li>VEX CORTEX</li>
<li>VEX Controller</li>
<li>VEX Radio</li>
<li>Wires (x3)</li>
<li>Battery and battery cable</li>
<li>C-channel (size doesn’t matter)</li>
<li>Toolbox
<ul>
<li>Flat Bearing</li>
<li>Shaft collars</li>
<li>Screws of assorted sizes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wheel (any size)</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>3/32’’ and 5/64’’ screwdrivers</li>
<li>3/32’’ and 5/64’’ allen wrenches (optional, but they help)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Place a flat bearing inside the C-channel with 2 screws and an axle. Place a shaft collar on the inside of the C-channel, on the axle. See the note below about choosing screw length for motors.</p>
<html><div class="row-container">
  <div><p><img alt="axle with two screws" src="img/building/1-2-1.png"></p></div>
  <div><p><img src="img/building/1-2-2.png" alt="axle with two screws and a collar"></p></div>
</div>
</html>
<h3>Note: Choosing screw length for motors</h3>
<html><div class="row-container">
  <div><p><img alt="max screw length for motor" src="img/building/1-2-3.png"></p></div>
</div>
</html>
<p>Choose a screw that will have enough room to bury deep in the motor, but not too deep. Try taking a long screw, like the one in the image at right, and spin it into a motor screw slot with your hand only. As a rule of thumb, as soon as you have to use your screwdriver to drive the motor screw, you are probably going too far (or the screw thread is bad). The image at right shows the maximum amount that the screw should go into the motor.</p>
<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>Align the motor so that the screw slots fit with the screws you placed in the previous step. Tighten the screws into the motor. Place the axle inside the motor’s square-shaped hole. It should be difficult to spin the bare axle with your free hand; when you spin the axle, you should hear motor spinning noises.</p>
<p>While lightly pushing the collar on to the bearing, tighten the shaft collar. The axle should be “frozen” in place by the collar; you shouldn’t be able to pull the axle out. This is the entire purpose of the shaft collar!</p>
<html><div class="row-container">
  <div><img alt="screws tightened into motor to attach motor" src="img/building/1-3-1.png"></div>
  <div><img alt="collar tightened to hold axle in motor" src="img/building/1-3-2.png"></div>
</div>
</html>
<h2>Step 4</h2>
<p>Place the parts in the given order along the axle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Washer (ideally plastic, but since we don’t have many of those, we usually use metal instead)</li>
<li>Collar</li>
<li>Wheel</li>
<li>Collar</li>
</ol>
<p>The wheel should be “sandwiched” by collars. This ensures that the wheel can’t move along the axle when the motor spins. One collar should be separated from the C-channel by a washer. This reduces metal-on-metal contact, thereby reducing friction.</p>
<html><div class="row-container">
  <div><p><img alt="axle with motor and wheel" src="img/building/1-4-1.png"></p></div>
</div>
</html>
<h2>Step 5</h2>
<p>Wire up your motor to the VEX electronics! Be sure to connect the motor to port 1. It doesn’t matter which ports the controller and radio are connected to. The Radio should have its red lights on.</p>
<html><div class="row-container">
  <div><p><img alt="labeled electronics" src="img/building/1-5-1.png"></p></div>
</div>
</html>
<h2>Step 6</h2>
<p>Turn on the CORTEX and controller. After the controller connects to the CORTEX with a wire, disconnect the wire connecting the controller and CORTEX. The controller should automatically switch to a wireless connection with the CORTEX.</p>

  <div><p><img alt="controller screen indicating that the controller is looking for a cortex" src="img/building/1-6-1.png"></p><p>The controller is looking for a CORTEX.</p></div>
  <div><p><img src="img/building/1-6-2.png" alt="controller screen indicating that the controller is wired to the cortex"></p><p>The controller is wired to the CORTEX.</p></div>
  <div><p><img alt="controller screen indicating that the controller is wirelessly connected to the cortex" src="img/building/1-6-3.png"></p><p>The controller is wirelessly controlled to the CORTEX, via the radio. This is usually how the controller should be set up.</p></div>
</div>
</html>
<h2>Step 7</h2>
<p>Select the “Drive” program on your controller (see the note below). Then hit Run, and you are done! You should be able to control the motor with the left joystick.</p>
<p><img src="img/building/1-7-1.png" alt="about to run the ‘drive’ program" /></p>
<h3>Note: Controlling the Controller</h3>
<p>Refer to the images below for a quick controller overview. Use the reset button if the controller ever freezes up.</p>

	<h1>Building a Drivetrain</h1>
	<p>In this module, we build a 2 wheel drive, tank-style drivetrain. This is the standard way to build a drivetrain that you will probably use in competition.</p>
	<hr />
	<div class="content"><h2>What you will build</h2>
<p>The final product will look something like this:
<img src="2-0-1.png" alt="final drivetrain" /></p>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Gather the necessary parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>VEX Motors (x2)</li>
<li>VEX CORTEX</li>
<li>VEX Controller</li>
<li>VEX Radio</li>
<li>VEX Wires (x4)</li>
<li>decently long C-channels (at least 25 holes long) (x2)</li>
<li>other C-channels (at least 15 holes long) (x2)</li>
<li>a 5-wide (at least 15 holes long, same length as the “other C-channels” above)</li>
<li>battery and battery cable</li>
<li>toolbox
<ul>
<li>flat bearing</li>
<li>shaft collars</li>
<li>screws</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note: C Channels</h3>
<p>C channels have grooves on the sides that indicate a group of 5 holes. This way, you can quickly count 4 grooves = 4*5 holes = 20 holes instead of counting each hole individually.
<img src="img/building/2-1-1.png" alt="15 hole C channel with every 5 holes marked" /></p>
<p>For this activity, make sure you have two pairs of C-channels with the same length. (You will eventually make a rectangular structure for the drivetrain)</p>
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Attach a motor to one of the longer C channels. Place an omniwheel on this motor. You can follow the instructions in the previous module titled “Putting on a Motor”. Be sure to leave enough space for a future structural element.
<img src="img/building/2-2-1.png" alt="motor with axle on C channel" />
As in the picture above, your motor axle should be at least the 4th hole from the last center hole. You will eventually place a perpendicular C-channel with the extra space you leave (see image below).
<img src="img/building/2-2-2.png" alt="motor with axle on C channel connected to another C channel" />
Remember to place an omniwheel on the axle (not a small traction wheel).
<img src="img/building/2-2-3.png" alt="motor on C channle with omniwheel" /></p>
<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>Place another wheel on the same C channel. Remember that the motor axle should be at least the 4th hole from the last center hole on the C channel.
<img src="img/building/2-3-1.png" alt="two axles on the 4th hole away from both edges" />
<img src="img/building/2-3-2.png" alt="two wheels on the same C channel - front view" />
<img src="img/building/2-3-3.png" alt="two wheels on the same C channel - 3D view" /></p>
<h2>Step 4</h2>
<p>Make another set of wheels. You will connect these two sets in the next step.
<img src="img/building/2-4-1.png" alt="two C channels; each C channel with 2 motor-powered wheels" /></p>
<h2>Step 5</h2>
<p>Connect the two sets of wheels with C channels. The connecting C channels should be at least 15 holes wide.
<img src="img/building/2-5-1.png" alt="4 motors connected with 2 C channels" /></p>
<h2>Step 6</h2>
<p>Now, we can place the CORTEX on the robot. Find a 5-wide C-channel at least as long as the connecting pieces you attached in the last step. Connect the CORTEX to the 5-wide with 4 screws.
<img src="img/building/2-6-1.png" alt="robot brain screwed to 5 wide C channel" /></p>
<h2>Step 7</h2>
<p>Screw 4 standoffs to the bottom of the 5-wide. The standoffs enable the CORTEX to face upward instead of downward when the CORTEX is connected to the robot.
<img src="img/building/2-7-1.png" alt="robot brain screwed to 5 wide C channel with 4 standoffs on each corner" /></p>
<h2>Step 8</h2>
<p>Screw this 5 channel to the robot.
<img src="img/building/2-8-1.png" alt="final drivetrain, top view" />
The below picture is taken from the robot’s underside.
